# react-lights-out-game

A simple react game

Description:

Lights Out is a simple puzzle game that involves a grid of squares that can either be turned on or off. The goal of the game is to turn off all the lights in the grid by toggling them on or off, with each toggle affecting the state of its adjacent lights.

At the beginning of the game, the grid is randomly populated with lights that are either on or off. The player must use their problem-solving skills to turn off all the lights by strategically toggling the lights on the grid.

To toggle a light, the player must click on it. Clicking on a light will change its state, as well as the state of the adjacent lights. If a light is turned off, it will turn on when toggled, and vice versa.

The challenge of the game lies in figuring out the right sequence of moves to turn off all the lights on the grid. The game can have different levels of difficulty, depending on the size of the grid and the number of lights.

Lights Out is a classic puzzle game that has been around for decades and has been adapted to various electronic devices, such as calculators, computers, and mobile phones. It is a great game for people who enjoy logical thinking and problem-solving challenges.
